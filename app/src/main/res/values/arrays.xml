        <item>Once home to the most advanced civilization on Earth, the city of Atlantis is now an underwater kingdom
            ruled by the power-hungry King Orm. With a vast army at his disposal, Orm plans to conquer the remaining

            retrieve the legendary Trident of Atlan and embrace his destiny as protector of the deep.

        <item>Bohemian Rhapsody is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music and their extraordinary lead
            singer Freddie Mercury. Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most
            beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their
            iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success,
            but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns
            Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen,
            Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent
            AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances
            in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders,
            dreamers and music lovers to this day

        <item>Sick, twisted, politically incorrect and Freakin\' Sweet animated series featuring the adventures of the
            dysfunctional Griffin family. Bumbling Peter and long-suffering Lois have three kids. Stewie
            (a brilliant but sadistic baby bent on killing his mother and taking over the world),
            Meg (the oldest, and is the most unpopular girl in town) and Chris (the middle kid, he\'s not
            very bright but has a passion for movies). The final member of the family is Brian - a talking
            dog and much more than a pet, he keeps Stewie in check whilst sipping Martinis and sorting through
            his own life issues.

        <item>After a particle accelerator causes a freak storm, CSI Investigator Barry Allen is struck by lightning and
            falls into a coma. Months later he awakens with the power of super speed, granting him the ability to move
            through Central City like an unseen guardian angel. Though initially excited by his newfound powers, Barry
            is shocked to discover he is not the only "meta-human" who was created in the wake of the accelerator
            explosion — and not everyone is using their new powers for good. Barry partners with S.T.A.R. Labs and
            dedicates his life to protect the innocent. For now, only a few close friends and associates know that Barry
            is literally the fastest man alive, but it won\'t be long before the world learns what Barry Allen has
            become The Flash.
